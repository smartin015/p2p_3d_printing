PeerPrint is a general-purpose toolkit for decentralized and distributed work management for 3D printers.

It allows print servers to self-organize and find each other on local (LAN) networks as well as global (WAN) networks with the help of the [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) library. 

This library isn't intended to be used directly; rather, it should be run alongside existing printer software which already controls print execution and treats PeerPrint as a source of work to be done.
